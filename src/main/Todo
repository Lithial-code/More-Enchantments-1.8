Counter Parry :
If you time your parries correctly within 0.75 seconds of the hit
(without spamming the right mouse button) you can:
Reduce damage by 1/2 heart * (parry level+1);
Block blaze/dispensor fireballs.
Apply damage to attacker (upto 1/2 heart per (parry_level +1)).
Slow attacker down for 1.5 seconds (again dependant on parry level).
Arrow Redirection:
LVL1-Parry: Arrows randomly deflected
LVL2-Parry: Arrows reflected back at source at 66% of the speed.
Increased damage on arrow;
